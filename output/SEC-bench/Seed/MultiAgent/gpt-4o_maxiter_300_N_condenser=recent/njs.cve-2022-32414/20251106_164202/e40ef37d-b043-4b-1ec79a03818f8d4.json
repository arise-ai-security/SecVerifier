Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/njs && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/njs && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/njs && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/njs && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/njs && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/njs && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/njs && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/njs && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/njs && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/njs && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/njs && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/njs && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `2e00e95473861846aa8538be87db07699d9f676d` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/njs && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/njs && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/njs && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",
