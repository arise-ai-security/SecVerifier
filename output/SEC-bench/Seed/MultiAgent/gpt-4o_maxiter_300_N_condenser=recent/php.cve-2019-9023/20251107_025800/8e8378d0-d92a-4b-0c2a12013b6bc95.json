At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\\n\\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\\n\\nTest script:\\n---------------\\nphp -r 'var_dump(mb_split(\\\"   \\\\xfd\\\",\\\"\\\"));'\\n\\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn't crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a file.\\n\\n$

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\\n\\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don't have this bug due to not having the file.\\n\\nPatch is

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25.

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\\n\\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don't have this bug due to not having the file.\\n\\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\\n\\n\\n\\nTest script:\\n---------------\\nphp -r 'var_dump(mb_ereg(\\\"()0\\\\xfc00000\\\\xfc00000\\\\xfc00000\\\\xfc\\\",\\\"\\\"));'\\n\\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\\n\\nExpected result:\\n----------------\\nno crash\\n\\nActual result:\\n--------------\\n$ ~/php-5.6.39/sapi/cli/php -r

20:41 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn't apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn->end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I'm yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\\n\\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node. Should I just file another bug report for that along with a test case to keep them seperate?\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\nHugh\\n\\n[Comment 4] [2018-12-30 22:39 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\\n#77381 is the new report for the one of the other enclen problems\\n\\nCommit References:\\nd949cca738a67419c7d73f032ffe81ca6b77d803\\n\\n================= Bug Report (3/7) ==================\\n## Source: PHP Bugs\\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77381\\n## Description:\\nPHP Bug ID: 77381\\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in multibyte match_at\\nStatus: Closed\\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\\nAssigned: stas (profile)\\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\\n\\nDescription:\\nDescription:\\n------------\\nCaused by an incomplete multibyte char at end of $pattern in mb_split and mb_ereg.

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\\n\\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\\n\\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\\n\\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\\n\\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don't have this bug due to not having the file.\\n\\nPatch is

20:41 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn't apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn->end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I'm yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\\n\\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r 'var_dump(mb_split(\"   \\xfd\",\"\"));'\n\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn't crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a file.\n\n$ xxd -g 1

Please verify.\nLinks: https://gist.github.com/smalyshev/4902bc13d34390d0068163d5d8fd64f7\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 20:25 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 7.1.25, 7.0.33, and 5.6.39.\n\nCommit References:\n0839641503bc381d64347081b4308dd7335a26b5\n\n================= Bug Report (2/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77371\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77371\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in mb regex functions - compile_string_node\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nAfter patching for #77370, I found another heap buffer overflow, based on incomplete multibyte strings in $pattern in mb regex functions such as mb_ereg, mb_split.\n\nNarrowed the bug down to the compile_string_node function in ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regcomp.c. In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don't have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r 'var_dump(mb_ereg(\"()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc\",\"\"));'\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected result:\n----------------\nno crash\n\nActual result:\n--------------\n$ ~/php-5.6.39/sapi/cli/php -r

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn't apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn->end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I'm yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node. Should I just file another bug report for that along with a test case to keep them seperate?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh\n\n[Comment 4] [2018-12-30 22:39 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\n#77381 is the new report for the one of the other enclen problems\n\nCommit References:\nd949cca738a67419c7d73f032ffe81ca6b77d803\n\n================= Bug Report (3/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77381\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77381\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in multibyte match_at\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nCaused by an incomplete multibyte char at end of $pattern in mb_split and mb_ereg.

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_split(&#34;   \\xfd&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn&#39;t crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a

Please verify.\nLinks: https://gist.github.com/smalyshev/4902bc13d34390d0068163d5d8fd64f7\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 20:25 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 7.1.25, 7.0.33, and 5.6.39.\n\nCommit References:\n0839641503bc381d64347081b4308dd7335a26b5\n\n================= Bug Report (2/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77371\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77371\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in mb regex functions - compile_string_node\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nAfter patching for #77370, I found another heap buffer overflow, based on incomplete multibyte strings in $pattern in mb regex functions such as mb_ereg, mb_split.\n\nNarrowed the bug down to the compile_string_node function in ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regcomp.c. In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected result:\n----------------\nno crash\n\nActual result:\n--------------\n$ ~/php-5.6.39/sapi/cli/php -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n=================================================================\n==4295==ERROR: AddressSanitizer:

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node. Should I just file another bug report for that along with a test case to keep them seperate?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh\n\n[Comment 4] [2018-12-30 22:39 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\n#77381 is the new report for the one of the other enclen problems\n\nCommit References:\nd949cca738a67419c7d73f032ffe81ca6b77d803\n\n================= Bug Report (3/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77381\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77381\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in multibyte match_at\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nCaused by an incomplete multibyte char at end of $pattern in mb_split and mb_ereg.

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r 'var_dump(mb_split(\"   \\xfd\",\"\"));'\n\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn't crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a file.\n\n$ xxd -g 1

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don't have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn't apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn->end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I'm yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node. Should I just file another bug report for that along with a test case to keep them seperate?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh\n\n[Comment 4] [2018-12-30 22:39 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\n#77381 is the new report for the one of the other enclen problems\n\nCommit References:\nd949cca738a67419c7d73f032ffe81ca6b77d803\n\n================= Bug Report (3/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77381\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77381\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in multibyte match_at\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nCaused by an incomplete multibyte char at end of $pattern in mb_split and mb_ereg.

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_split(&#34;   \\xfd&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn&#39;t crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_split(&#34;   \\xfd&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\non php 5.6, weirdly it didn&#39;t crash with a plain string, but could get it to crash passing in a

Please verify.\nLinks: https://gist.github.com/smalyshev/4902bc13d34390d0068163d5d8fd64f7\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 20:25 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 7.1.25, 7.0.33, and 5.6.39.\n\nCommit References:\n0839641503bc381d64347081b4308dd7335a26b5\n\n================= Bug Report (2/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77371\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77371\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in mb regex functions - compile_string_node\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nAfter patching for #77370, I found another heap buffer overflow, based on incomplete multibyte strings in $pattern in mb regex functions such as mb_ereg, mb_split.\n\nNarrowed the bug down to the compile_string_node function in ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regcomp.c. In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected result:\n----------------\nno crash\n\nActual result:\n--------------\n$ ~/php-5.6.39/sapi/cli/php -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n=================================================================\n==4295==ERROR: AddressSanitizer:

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node. Should I just file another bug report for that along with a test case to keep them seperate?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh\n\n[Comment 4] [2018-12-30 22:39 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\n#77381 is the new report for the one of the other enclen problems\n\nCommit References:\nd949cca738a67419c7d73f032ffe81ca6b77d803\n\n================= Bug Report (3/7) ==================\n## Source: PHP Bugs\n## URL: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77381\n## Description:\nPHP Bug ID: 77381\nSummary: heap buffer overflow in multibyte match_at\nStatus: Closed\nPHP Version: 5.6.39\nAssigned: stas (profile)\nCVE-ID: 2019-9023\n\nDescription:\nDescription:\n------------\nCaused by an incomplete multibyte char at end of $pattern in mb_split and mb_ereg.

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

At completion of the method it sets *src to be where the pointer is currently (p). If there is an unfinished multibyte char at the end of the string then p can go beyond end. This causes flow on affects where src is then passed to onig_node_str_cat with *src which points past the end of the string buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow, which could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nCould reproduce this on php 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. I could not reproduce on 7.2.13, 7.3.0 or master due to the file being replaced.\n\nA patch to fix is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/c5696e48ea3a83bfe12075f79b2b5abf\n\nTest

In the function, the length of a string is calculated, and is used in add_compile_string. If the string has an unfinished multibyte character at the end of the string, then the length will overflow the end of the buffer.\n\nThis could cause memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced on 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1 (after patch for #77370 is applied, otherwise that case gets hit first). 7.2, 7.3 and master don&#39;t have this bug due to not having the file.\n\nPatch is available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/89849d35cc27c2242edcce4eb7c93520\n\n\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r &#39;var_dump(mb_ereg(&#34;()0\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc00000\\xfc&#34;,&#34;&#34;));&#39;\n\nthe patch from #77370 needs to be applied first to get to this point.\n\nExpected

hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nVerified on 5.6, 7.0. Patch didn&#39;t apply cleanly to 7.1 (my bad!). Needs to test against sn-&gt;end instead of end in 7.1.25. That also fixes another bug I&#39;m yet to file for 7.1, but still affects 5.6 and 7.0 so will hopefully write that up today\n\n[Comment 3] [2018-12-30 21:09 UTC] hugh at allthethings dot co dot nz\nSorry, I had that file edited, but I found another instance where it could get fixed in compile_length_string_node.

This can result in memory corruption and/or leakage.\n\nReproduced in 5.6.39, 7.0.33, and 7.1.25. Not an issue in 7.2, 7.3 and master.\n\nPatch available at https://gist.github.com/hughdavenport/7f7b78c08aea058eaa955510d1548f12\n\nTest script:\n---------------\nphp -r

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `05fb10165081cb4fb55a9943b44cab62c627db7a` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/php-src && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/php-src && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.",

This suggests that the compiler might be generating incorrect assembly code for the target architecture. The issue could be related to the `-march=armv8-a` flag, which might not be suitable for the current build environment. I will try removing or adjusting this flag to see if it resolves the issue.\"}",
