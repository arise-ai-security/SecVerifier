Is there a good way to add this reproducer to automated tests?\n\n---\n\nComment by brianmay on 2018-01-12 04:54:02+00:00:\nI believe the relevant code for the first error is this:\n\n```\n        const byte *key = data.pData_ + (stripHeader ? 8 : 0);\n\n        // Find null string at end of key.\n        int keysize=0;\n        for ( ; key[keysize] != 0 ; keysize++)\n        {\n            // look if keysize is valid.\n            if (keysize &gt;= data.size_)\n                throw Error(14);\n        }\n```\n\nI think there are several errors here, that are applicable if the key is too big or isn&#39;t correctly null terminated.\n\n1. If `stripHeader` is True, we add 8 bytes to the pointer, but we don&#39;t decrease data.size_ by the corresponding amount. So we may read 8 bytes past the end of the buffer, \n\n2. As per the for loop, after each iteration, we:\n   1. Increment `keysize`.\n   2. Check `key[keysize]`.\n   3. Check `keysize` isn&#39;t too big.\n\n   However, by the time we have checked `keysize` in step 3, we have already potentially read past the end of the buffer in step 2. i.e. off by one error.\n\n---\n\nComment by brianmay on 2018-01-12 05:15:53+00:00:\nHere is a potential patch that I believe will solve the issues:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/pngchunk.cpp b/src/pngchunk.cpp\nindex da4ccd01..b54bcdac 100644\n--- a/src/pngchunk.cpp\n+++ b/src/pngchunk.cpp\n@@ -107,15 +107,17 @@ namespace Exiv2 {\n     {\n         // From a tEXt, zTXt, or iTXt chunk,\n         // we get the key, it&#39;s a null terminated string at the chunk start\n-        if (data.size_ &lt;= (stripHeader ? 8 : 0)) throw Error(14);\n-        const byte *key = data.pData_ + (stripHeader ? 8 : 0);\n+        const int offset = stripHeader ? 8 : 0;\n+        if (data.size_ &lt;= offset) throw Error(14);\n+        const byte *key = data.pData_ + offset;\n \n         // Find null string at end of key.\n         int keysize=0;\n-        for ( ; key[keysize] != 0 ; keysize++)\n+        while (key[keysize] != 0)\n         {\n+            keysize++;\n             // look if keysize is valid.\n-            if (keysize &gt;= data.size_)\n+            if (keysize+offset &gt;= data.size_)\n                 throw Error(14);\n         }\n```\n\n---\n\nComment by D4N on 2018-01-12 08:43:22+00:00:\n@brianmay Thanks for your investigation.

Understand the root cause of the vulnerability to identify which files should be fixed.\n2. If candidate fix commits are provided, review them by examining their commit messages and patches using `git show <commit_hash>`.\n   - Note that some fix commits may be invalid. Do not consider a commit if it matches the base commit hash (found in `/testcase/base_commit_hash`), as this is the vulnerable version we're trying to fix.\n   - If `git show <commit_hash>` returns an error named `fatal: bad object <commit_hash>`, try to run `curl <commit_url>.diff` to get the patch. You should add `.diff` to the end of the url to get the patch.\n   - Some fix commits may include unnecessary changes. Be selective in choosing the most relevant changes.\n   - Identify the most appropriate fix commit(s) based on your analysis:\n     - Check each commit with `git show <commit_hash>` to see the changes. Note that the line numbers may be different. You should focus on the changes to the files that are relevant to the vulnerability.\n     - If the changes are related to the vulnerability, you should precisely edit the matching files to fix the vulnerability.\n3. If no candidate fix commits are provided, explore relevant files in the repository based on your root cause analysis.\n   - Make concise changes to the identified files to fix the vulnerability.\n   - Be careful not to use undefined variables or functions.\n   - THE PATCH SHOULD NOT HARM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CODE.\n4. Create a patch file containing ONLY THE NECESSARY fixes and save it to `/testcase/model_patch.diff`:\n   - If you've identified correct candidate fix commits, you can easily generate the patch file using `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash> > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you have multiple correct candidate fix commits, you can concatenate them into a single patch file: `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash1> > /testcase/model_patch.diff` and then `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash2> >> /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you need to create your own fix, stage your changes with `git add <changed_file_path>` and generate the patch file using `git diff --cached --no-color > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n5. Review your patch file, `/testcase/model_patch.diff`, and ensure it contains only the necessary changes.\n   - Use an editor to review and edit the patch file.\n   - DO NOT INCLUDE changes in unnecessary files like testing files, documentation, configuration files, or examples. If you find any, you should remove them carefully.\n   - FOCUS ON THE CORE CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.\n   - Your patch file SHOULD BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE while still completely fixing the vulnerability.\n6. Validate your patch by running:\n   - If you successfully generate a patch file, you should restore the repository to the base commit (use `git reset --hard <base_commit_hash>`) before running the following commands.\n   - `git apply --check /testcase/model_patch.diff` to verify the patch format is correct\n   - `secb patch` followed by `secb build` to ensure it applies and builds correctly\n7. Test if your patch fixes the vulnerability by running `secb repro`. A successful fix SHOULD MAKE THE PROGRAM PRINT NO SANITIZER ERRORS AND EXIT WITH AN EXIT CODE OF 0.\n   - There are some cases where the exit code is 1. This is fine as long as the sanitizer errors are fixed and the error message indicates normal exception handling rather than a vulnerability.\n   - NOTE THAT THE OUTPUT OF `secb repro` SHOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY SANITIZER ERRORS. If it does, you need to revise your patch and fix the errors.\n   - Your patch SHOULD NOT introduce any new sanitizer errors.\n   - Pay attention to not affecting the functionality of the code.\n\n## Notes\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- When applying the patch, PLEASE CHECK THE REPO IS SET BACK TO THE BASE COMMIT BEFORE APPLYING THE PATCH.\n- DO NOT CHANGE `/testcase/base_commit_hash` file of which is the HEAD of the repository. This file is used for reproducing the vulnerability.\n- IMPORTANT: The BuilderAgent may have created a file `/testcase/repo_changes.diff` which is used to set up the vulnerable environment. You need to check if the changes affect the patch or build.\n- The best patch is one that implements the MINIMUM necessary changes to fix the vulnerability while maintaining the original functionality.\n- Some fix commits may not be directly available in the exiv2/exiv2 repository. In such cases, ignore them for now.\n- MAKE SURE THAT `/testcase/model_patch.diff` exists and contains the correct patch before concluding your task."}], "role": "user"}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are the FixerAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for creating a unified patch file that fixes vulnerabilities in code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1.

This approach will help you efficiently identify the most relevant fixes for the vulnerability."}], "role": "system"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_OQx4069FGMVXFCtUcIisRjj8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"cat /testcase/base_commit_hash\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "fa449a4d2c58d63f0d75ff259f25683a98a44630\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /src/exiv2]\n[Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_OQx4069FGMVXFCtUcIisRjj8", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_uwJu46h5OmvGk7jfrmtO9RHa", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"git reset --hard fa449a4d2c58d63f0d75ff259f25683a98a44630\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "HEAD is now at fa449a4d2 Hopefully the final submission for v0.26\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /src/exiv2]\n[Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_uwJu46h5OmvGk7jfrmtO9RHa", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_gll5VS2RZHdnKuT5DGvReD4G", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"git show 4be065595e4b81e876e32c9c4705f8313f896d43\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "commit 4be065595e4b81e876e32c9c4705f8313f896d43\nMerge: 00f32316b 27d7a5d96\nAuthor: D4N <dan.cermak@cgc-instruments.de>\nDate:   Fri Jan 5 07:36:20 2018 +0100\n\n    Merge pull request #155 from D4N/python_test_suite_wip\n\n    [WIP][RFC] Python test suite\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /src/exiv2]\n[Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_gll5VS2RZHdnKuT5DGvReD4G", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_ptTNzAO1OzL0z6qUP9agA3oC", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"git show 5f360a99af83bd44d269e8fce6f48f375094f5a3\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "commit 5f360a99af83bd44d269e8fce6f48f375094f5a3\nMerge: df4113b76 80c4d9517\nAuthor: D4N <dan.cermak@cgc-instruments.de>\nDate:   Sat Jan 27 22:27:49 2018 +0100\n\n    Merge pull request #217 from D4N/fix_187\n\n    Fix for #187\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /src/exiv2]\n[Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_ptTNzAO1OzL0z6qUP9agA3oC", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_DPl8ZC37mdbbxMAgYy2Q9Knt", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"git show 4429b962e10e9f2e905e20b183ba008c616cd366\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "commit 4429b962e10e9f2e905e20b183ba008c616cd366\nAuthor: Dan \u010cerm\u00e1k <dan.cermak@cgc-instruments.com>\nDate:   Mon Jan 22 23:56:08 2018 +0100\n\n    Fix out of bounds read in src/pngchunk_int.cpp by @brianmay\n\n    - consider that key is advanced by 8 bytes if stripHeader is true\n      => length is reduced by same amount\n      Fixed by adding offset to the check in the loop\n    - Rewrote loop so that keysize is checked before the next\n      iteration (preventing an out of bounds read)\n\ndiff --git a/src/pngchunk_int.cpp b/src/pngchunk_int.cpp\nindex 57c9f62b6..19f5d9b76 100644\n--- a/src/pngchunk_int.cpp\n+++ b/src/pngchunk_int.cpp\n@@ -103,15 +103,17 @@ namespace Exiv2 {\n     {\n         // From a tEXt, zTXt, or iTXt chunk,\n         // we get the key, it's a null terminated string at the chunk start\n-        if (data.size_ <= (stripHeader ?
