Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `473664b1e7fa76bcb72a1cb4f1c01e1e820b7c81`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `473664b1e7fa76bcb72a1cb4f1c01e1e820b7c81` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/radare2 && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/radare2 && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/radare2 && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."}], "role": "user"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_0TSHXcpivs51WYxw7iL4oMTK", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"r2pm -h\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "bash: r2pm: command not found\n[The command completed with exit code 127.]\n[Current working directory: /src/radare2]\n[Python interpreter: /openhands/poetry/openhands-ai-5O4_aCHf-py3.12/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 127]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_0TSHXcpivs51WYxw7iL4oMTK", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_0wgtP2pWFhvXmNyEPM4p6G1h", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "think", "arguments": "{\"thought\":\"The 'r2pm' command is not found, which means it's not installed or not available in the current environment.

The current git `master` branch is `5.9.9`, next will be `6.0.0`.\n\n* Since 5.6.0, patch releases are [abi stable](doc/abi.md)\n* Even patch numbers used for releases, odd ones for git.\n* .9 patch versions reflect the abi breaking seasson\n\n### Description\n\nr2 is a complete rewrite of radare. It provides a set of libraries, tools and\nplugins to ease reverse engineering tasks. Distributed mostly under LGPLv3,\neach plugin can have different licenses (see r2 -L, rasm2 -L, ...).\n\nThe radare project started as a simple command-line hexadecimal editor focused\non forensics. Today, r2 is a featureful low-level command-line tool with\nsupport for scripting with the embedded Javascript interpreter or via r2pipe.\n\nr2 can edit files on local hard drives, view kernel memory, and debug programs\nlocally or via a remote gdb/windbg servers. r2's wide architecture support allows\nyou to analyze, emulate, debug, modify, and disassemble any binary.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://www.radare.org/\"><img src=\"doc/images/shot.png\" alt=\"screenshot\" align=\"center\" border=0 width=\"600px\"></a>\n</p>\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended way to install radare2 is via Git using acr/make or meson:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2\nradare2/sys/install.sh\n```\n\nOn Windows you may want to use the precompiled builds or the .bat files to compile if you have msvc:\n\n```bat\npreconfigure.bat       REM setup python, meson, ninja\nconfigure.bat          REM run meson b + vs project\nmake.bat               REM run ninja -C b\nprefix\\bin\\radare2.exe\n```\n\n* r2 can be installed from `git` or via `pip` using `r2env`.\n* Run `sys/install.sh` for the default acr+make+symlink installation\n* meson/ninja (muon/samu also works) and make builds are supported.\n* Windows builds require meson and msvc or mingw as compilers\n* To uninstall the current build of r2 run `make uninstall`\n* To uninstall ALL the system installations of r2 do: `sudo make purge`\n\n## Popular Plugins:\n\nUsing the `r2pm` tool you can browse and install many plugins and tools that use radare2.\n\n* [esilsolve](https://github.com/radareorg/esilsolve): The symbolic execution plugin, based on esil and z3\n* [iaito](https://github.com/radareorg/iaito): The official Qt graphical interface\n* [keystone](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-extras/tree/master/keystone) Assembler instructions using the Keystone library\n* [decai](https://github.com/radareorg/r2ai) Decompiler based on AI\n* [r2ai](https://github.com/radareorg/r2ai) Run a Language Model in localhost with Llama inside r2!\n* [r2dec](https://github.com/wargio/r2dec-js): A decompiler based on r2 written in JS, accessed with the `pdd` command\n* [r2diaphora](https://github.com/FernandoDoming/r2diaphora): [Diaphora](https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora)'s binary diffing engine on top of radare2\n* [r2frida](https://github.com/nowsecure/r2frida): The frida io plugin. Start r2 with `r2 frida://0` to use it\n* [r2ghidra](https://github.com/radareorg/r2ghidra): The standalone native ghidra decompiler accessible with `pdg`\n* [r2papi](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-r2papi) High level api on top of r2pipe\n* [r2pipe](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-r2pipe) Script radare2 from any programming language\n* [r2poke](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-extras/tree/master/r2poke) Integration with GNU/Poke for extended binary parsing capabilities\n* [goresym](https://github.com/hanemile/radare2-GoReSym): Import GoReSym symbol as flags\n* [r2yara](https://github.com/radareorg/r2yara) Run Yara from r2 or use r2 primitives from Yara\n* [radius2](https://github.com/nowsecure/radius2): A fast symbolic execution engine based on boolector and esil\n* [r2sarif](https://github.com/radareorg/r2sarif) import/extend/export SARIF documents\n\n## Usage\n\nThese are the first steps to use r2, read the book or find tutorials for more details\n\n```sh\n$ r2 /bin/ls   # open file in read-only\n> aaa          # analyse the program (r2 -A)\n> afl          # list all functions (try aflt, aflm)\n> px 32        # print 32 byte hexdump current block\n> s sym.main   # seek to main (using flag name)\n> f~foo        # filter flags matching 'foo' (internal |grep)\n> iS;is        # list sections and symbols (rabin2 -Ss)\n> pdf; agf     # disassembly and ascii-art function graph\n> oo+;w hello  # reopen in read-write and write a string\n> ?*~...       # interactive filter in all command help\n> q            # quit\n```\n\nMany plugins are included in r2 by default. But you can extend its capabilities\nby using the [r2pm](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-pm) package manager.\n\n```sh\nr2pm -s <word>  # search packages matching a word\nr2pm -Uci <pkg> # update database and clean install a package\nr2pm -u <pkg>   # uninstall the given package\nr2pm -l <pkg>   # list installed packages\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Official Book](https://book.rada.re): Read about r2 usage\n* [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md): Community engagement and loose guidelines\n* [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Information about reporting issues and\n  contributing.
