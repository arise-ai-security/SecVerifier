Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/imagemagick && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/imagemagick && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/imagemagick && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."},"thought":"I need to delegate to the BuilderAgent first to handle build script validation and fixing for instance imagemagick.cve-2019-13297."}},{"id":6,"timestamp":"2025-11-01T21:31:23.002984","source":"agent","message":"You are the BuilderAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for fixing and optimizing build processes for code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1.

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/imagemagick && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/imagemagick && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/imagemagick && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.","action":"message","args":{"content":"TASK: ## Repository Information\n<REPOSITORY_INFO>\n/src/imagemagick\n</REPOSITORY_INFO>\nI've uploaded a code repository at /src/imagemagick with the base commit `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc` for imagemagick.cve-2019-13297.\nHowever, you should update `/src/build.sh` which is in the outside of the repository.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n================= Bug Report (1/1) ==================\n## Source: GitHub Issue\n## URL: https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1609\n## Description:\nIssue: ImageMagick/ImageMagick#1609\nTitle: heap-buffer-overflow at MagickCore/threshold.c:328:11 in AdaptiveThresholdImage\nState: closed\nCreated by: SuhwanSong\nCreated at: 2019-06-21 06:02:04+00:00\nLabels: bug\n\nIssue Body:\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [x] I have verified that I am using the latest version of ImageMagick\n- [x] I have searched [open](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to ensure it has not already been reported\n\n### Description\n&lt;!-- A description of the bug or feature --&gt;\nThere&#39;s a heap-buffer-overflow at MagickCore/threshold.c:328:11 in AdaptiveThresholdImage.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n&lt;!-- List of steps, sample code, failing test or link to a project that reproduces the behavior.\n     Make sure you place a stack trace inside a code (```) block to avoid linking unrelated issues --&gt;\nrun_cmd:\n`magick -seed 0 -dispose Background &#34;(&#34; magick:netscape -lat 514x0-41  &#34;)&#34; &#34;(&#34; magick:granite -charcoal 3 -level 0%,125,0.328  &#34;)&#34; -combine -print &#34;&#34;   tmp`\n\nHere&#39;s ASAN log.\n```\n==22189==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x620000001090 at pc 0x7fd7e5dd4be2 bp 0x7ffd816c3a30 sp 0x7ffd816c3a28\nREAD of size 4 at 0x620000001090 thread T0\n    #0 0x7fd7e5dd4be1 in AdaptiveThresholdImage MagickCore/threshold.c:328:11\n    #1 0x7fd7e5386cb6 in CLISimpleOperatorImage MagickWand/operation.c:2571:21\n    #2 0x7fd7e537bc78 in CLISimpleOperatorImages MagickWand/operation.c:3685:12\n    #3 0x7fd7e53a1315 in CLIOption MagickWand/operation.c:5273:16\n    #4 0x7fd7e51e2a99 in ProcessCommandOptions MagickWand/magick-cli.c:477:7\n    #5 0x7fd7e51e3d0a in MagickImageCommand MagickWand/magick-cli.c:796:5\n    #6 0x7fd7e522dba1 in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/mogrify.c:185:14\n    #7 0x526f95 in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:149:10\n    #8 0x5268e1 in main utilities/magick.c:180:10\n    #9 0x7fd7dfca4b96 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21b96)\n    #10 0x41b069 in _start (install/bin/magick+0x41b069)\n\nAddress 0x620000001090 is a wild pointer.\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow MagickCore/threshold.c:328:11 in AdaptiveThresholdImage\n```\n\n### System Configuration\n&lt;!-- Tell us about the environment where you are experiencing the bug --&gt;\n\n- ImageMagick version:\nVersion: ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 x86_64 2019-06-21 https://imagemagick.org\n\n- Environment (Operating system, version and so on):\nDescription:\tUbuntu 18.04.1 LTS\nRelease:\t18.04\nCodename: bionic\n\n- Additional information:\nCC=clang-7 CXX=clang++-7 ./configure --disable-openmp\n&lt;!-- Thanks for reporting the issue to ImageMagick! --&gt;\n\n\n\nComments:\nComment by urban-warrior on 2019-06-21 21:31:26+00:00:\nThanks for the problem report.

Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `a7759f410b773a1dd57b0e1fb28112e1cd8b97bc` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/imagemagick && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h.

This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.","thought":""}},{"id":10,"timestamp":"2025-11-01T21:31:23.005865","source":"environment","message":"Added workspace context","cause":9,"observation":"recall","content":"Added workspace context","extras":{"recall_type":"workspace_context","repo_name":"","repo_directory":"","repo_branch":"","repo_instructions":"","runtime_hosts":{"http://host.docker.internal:53429":53429,"http://host.docker.internal:57469":57469},"additional_agent_instructions":"","date":"2025-11-01","custom_secrets_descriptions":{},"conversation_instructions":"","working_dir":"/workspace","microagent_knowledge":[{"name":"github","trigger":"github","content":"You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe GitHub API.\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nYou can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.\nALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.\nALWAYS use the `create_pr` tool to open a pull request\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nIf you encounter authentication issues when pushing to GitHub (such as password prompts or permission errors), the old token may have expired.

Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the `create_mr` tool to create a merge request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a merge request, continue to update it.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems running the affected software.\n\nRelevant Links:\nhttps://github.com/gpac/gpac\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n1. Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/gpac && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs."},"thought":"I need to delegate to the BuilderAgent first to handle build script validation and fixing for instance gpac.cve-2023-5586."}},{"id":6,"timestamp":"2025-11-01T21:46:56.494185","source":"agent","message":"You are the BuilderAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for fixing and optimizing build processes for code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1.

Additionally, the attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or making it unresponsive. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems running the affected software.\n\nRelevant Links:\nhttps://github.com/gpac/gpac\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n1. Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/gpac && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.","action":"message","args":{"content":"TASK: ## Repository Information\n<REPOSITORY_INFO>\n/src/gpac\n</REPOSITORY_INFO>\nI've uploaded a code repository at /src/gpac with the base commit `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596` for gpac.cve-2023-5586.\nHowever, you should update `/src/build.sh` which is in the outside of the repository.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n================= Bug Report (1/1) ==================\n## Source: Huntr\n## URL: https://huntr.dev/bounties/d2a6ea71-3555-47a6-9b18-35455d103740\n## Description:\nDescription\nNULL Pointer Dereference in function gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal at filter_core/filter_pck.c:108.\nVersion\ngit log\ncommit 5692dc729491805e0e5f55c21d50ba1e6b19e88e (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\nAuthor: Aurelien David &lt;aurelien.david@telecom-paristech.fr&gt;\nDate:   Wed Oct 11 13:24:46 2023 +0200\n\n    ac3dmx: add remain size check (fixes #2627)\n\n./MP4Box -version\nMP4Box - GPAC version 2.3-DEV-rev577-g5692dc729-master\n(c) 2000-2023 Telecom Paris distributed under LGPL v2.1+ - http://gpac.io\nProof of Concept\nreported (no instrumented program)\n./configure --enable-sanitizer\nmake\n\n\n./bin/gcc/MP4Box -dash 1000 -out /dev/null   poc2_nul\n\n[Dasher] No template assigned, using $File$_dash$FS$$Number$\n[PCMReframe] Missing audio sample rate, cannot parse\nfilter_core/filter_pck.c:108:6: runtime error: member access within null pointer of type &#39;struct GF_FilterPid&#39;\nReported with ASAN (instrumented program):\n\n./bin/gcc/MP4Box -dash 1000 -out /dev/null   poc2_null\n[Dasher] No template assigned, using $File$_dash$FS$$Number$\n[PCMReframe] Missing audio sample rate, cannot parse\nAddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL\n=================================================================\n==2015631==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7f6dd4798891 bp 0x7ffee005d790 sp 0x7ffee005d6a0 T0)\n==2015631==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.\n==2015631==Hint: address points to the zero page.\n    #0 0x7f6dd4798891 in gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x119b891)\n    #1 0x7f6dd4d1ef00 in pcmreframe_process (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1721f00)\n    #2 0x7f6dd48571ce in gf_filter_process_task (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x125a1ce)\n    #3 0x7f6dd4825216 in gf_fs_thread_proc (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1228216)\n    #4 0x7f6dd4823b0f in gf_fs_run (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1226b0f)\n    #5 0x7f6dd41c2047 in gf_dasher_process (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0xbc5047)\n    #6 0x50205c in do_dash /home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/applications/mp4box/mp4box.c:4831:15\n    #7 0x4f34ee in mp4box_main /home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/applications/mp4box/mp4box.c:6245:7\n    #8 0x7f6dd327e082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-SzIz7B/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #9 0x42ad4d in _start (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/MP4Box+0x42ad4d)\n\nAddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x119b891) in gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal\nPOC:  \n\nhttps://github.com/Janette88/test_pocs/blob/main/poc2_null\nImpact\nThis vulnerability is capable of making the MP4Box crash, An attacker who can successfully exploit this vulnerability could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, leading to a compromise of the system where the vulnerable software is installed.

If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3. If you encounter compiler errors about missing type specifiers (such as \"defaults to 'int'\" or \"implicit int\" errors), add the appropriate type declaration (like `int`, `void`, etc.) before the variable or function declaration.\n4. If you find errors related to function calls with incorrect number of arguments (e.g., \"error: too few arguments to function call\"), identify the problematic function and replace it with an appropriate alternative. For example, replace deprecated functions like `readdir_r` with modern equivalents like `readdir` and adjust the arguments accordingly.\n5. If you encounter `error: functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded` errors, add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` option to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n\n## Notes\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT DISABLE SANITIZER options in the build script. Sanitizers are essential for reproducing the bug with proper error reports. The sanitizer compile flags are already properly configured in the separate build script at `/usr/local/bin/compile`.\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- Be careful about running commands that may output long logs like `git log --oneline`. Use `head` command to limit the output (e.g., `git log --oneline | head -n 10`). This prevents overwhelming output that could interfere with your analysis.\n- If you find the bug errors are hard to fix, you should use Browsing tool to find a solution on web.\n- When you change source code files, you should be careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase.\n- Always use concrete commands like 'ls', 'cat', 'find', or 'grep' to explore the codebase before making changes.\n- MUST USE `secb build` to build the project in the repository path to prevent long but unneeded output logs which may cause your analysis to fail.\n- IF YOU HAVE TO RUN custom commands other than `secb build` to build the project, please make sure to add `1> /dev/null` to the end of the command to prevent long output logs.","file_urls":null,"image_urls":null,"wait_for_response":false}},{"id":9,"timestamp":"2025-11-01T21:46:56.495615","source":"user","message":"Retrieving content for: TASK: ## Repository Information\n<REPOSITORY_INFO>\n","action":"recall","args":{"recall_type":"workspace_context","query":"TASK: ## Repository Information\n<REPOSITORY_INFO>\n/src/gpac\n</REPOSITORY_INFO>\nI've uploaded a code repository at /src/gpac with the base commit `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596` for gpac.cve-2023-5586.\nHowever, you should update `/src/build.sh` which is in the outside of the repository.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n<ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n================= Bug Report (1/1) ==================\n## Source: Huntr\n## URL: https://huntr.dev/bounties/d2a6ea71-3555-47a6-9b18-35455d103740\n## Description:\nDescription\nNULL Pointer Dereference in function gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal at filter_core/filter_pck.c:108.\nVersion\ngit log\ncommit 5692dc729491805e0e5f55c21d50ba1e6b19e88e (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\nAuthor: Aurelien David &lt;aurelien.david@telecom-paristech.fr&gt;\nDate:   Wed Oct 11 13:24:46 2023 +0200\n\n    ac3dmx: add remain size check (fixes #2627)\n\n./MP4Box -version\nMP4Box - GPAC version 2.3-DEV-rev577-g5692dc729-master\n(c) 2000-2023 Telecom Paris distributed under LGPL v2.1+ - http://gpac.io\nProof of Concept\nreported (no instrumented program)\n./configure --enable-sanitizer\nmake\n\n\n./bin/gcc/MP4Box -dash 1000 -out /dev/null   poc2_nul\n\n[Dasher] No template assigned, using $File$_dash$FS$$Number$\n[PCMReframe] Missing audio sample rate, cannot parse\nfilter_core/filter_pck.c:108:6: runtime error: member access within null pointer of type &#39;struct GF_FilterPid&#39;\nReported with ASAN (instrumented program):\n\n./bin/gcc/MP4Box -dash 1000 -out /dev/null   poc2_null\n[Dasher] No template assigned, using $File$_dash$FS$$Number$\n[PCMReframe] Missing audio sample rate, cannot parse\nAddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL\n=================================================================\n==2015631==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7f6dd4798891 bp 0x7ffee005d790 sp 0x7ffee005d6a0 T0)\n==2015631==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.\n==2015631==Hint: address points to the zero page.\n    #0 0x7f6dd4798891 in gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x119b891)\n    #1 0x7f6dd4d1ef00 in pcmreframe_process (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1721f00)\n    #2 0x7f6dd48571ce in gf_filter_process_task (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x125a1ce)\n    #3 0x7f6dd4825216 in gf_fs_thread_proc (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1228216)\n    #4 0x7f6dd4823b0f in gf_fs_run (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x1226b0f)\n    #5 0x7f6dd41c2047 in gf_dasher_process (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0xbc5047)\n    #6 0x50205c in do_dash /home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/applications/mp4box/mp4box.c:4831:15\n    #7 0x4f34ee in mp4box_main /home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/applications/mp4box/mp4box.c:6245:7\n    #8 0x7f6dd327e082 in __libc_start_main /build/glibc-SzIz7B/glibc-2.31/csu/../csu/libc-start.c:308:16\n    #9 0x42ad4d in _start (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/MP4Box+0x42ad4d)\n\nAddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV (/home/fuzz/gpac/gpac/bin/gcc/libgpac.so.12+0x119b891) in gf_filter_pck_new_alloc_internal\nPOC:  \n\nhttps://github.com/Janette88/test_pocs/blob/main/poc2_null\nImpact\nThis vulnerability is capable of making the MP4Box crash, An attacker who can successfully exploit this vulnerability could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, leading to a compromise of the system where the vulnerable software is installed. Additionally, the attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or making it unresponsive. This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems running the affected software.\n\nRelevant Links:\nhttps://github.com/gpac/gpac\n</ISSUE_DESCRIPTION>\n\n## Step-by-step instructions\n1. Read the vulnerability description to determine the most suitable base commit:\n   - Currently, the base commit of the repository is `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596`\n   - If you identify a more suitable base commit based on the description:\n     a. Save the commit hash to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n     b. Switch to this commit using `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`\n   - Otherwise, use the provided `50a60b0e560f4c2d36198a231f952c876a760596` as the base commit:\n     a. Save it to `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - Note that `/testcase/base_commit_hash` FILE SHOULD BE CREATED before moving to the next step.\n2. Run `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command to build the project and check if the build is successful.\n3. Improve the build script (`/src/build.sh`) by following the requirements below. Make concise but complete improvements.\n    a. Make it standalone - remove any undefined variables or environment variables that aren't set in the script.\n    b. Remove any fuzzer-related build commands - this script should only contain commands for building the project\n    c. For `make` commands, add the `-j$(nproc)` option to utilize multiple processors. DO NOT INCLUDE options like `make all` or `make install`.\n    d. For directory creation commands, add the `-p` option to `mkdir` to make them error-free\n    e. Keep only essential build commands that are necessary for compiling the project\n    f. Remove any test or reproduction-related commands\n    g. For compiler options:\n       - Preserve existing flags when adding new ones (e.g., `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -fsanitize=address\"`)\n       - The `export` command should be defined before `./configure` or `cmake` command in the build script.\n       - Only modify compiler flags when necessary for the build process\n    h. For local script (e.g., ./autogen.sh) execution add the following checks:\n       - Check if the script exists before running it\n       - Skip non-existent scripts without exiting\n       - Add execution permissions if needed\n    i. Cleaning project commands such as `make clean` should be located before `configure` and `make` commands.\n    j. Exceptionally, if `$SRC` or `$WORK` is used in the script, it is predefined with `/src` or `/work` directory and can be used without definition.\n4. Build the project using `cd /src/gpac && secb build` command. Note that `secb build` command should be executed in the repository path.\n5. If there are build errors, carefully analyze the BUILD ERRORS ONLY and identify quick solutions\n    a. Ignore `warning` messages\n    b. Sometimes, you can easily fix build errors by adding suppression flags to the compiler flags without changing source code.\n       - When adding suppression flags, please add them before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n    c. If you need to change source code in the repository, please be very careful to avoid using undefined variables or functions in the codebase. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES.\n6. If you successfully installed any packages via `apt` command, write the name of each package in the `/testcase/packages.txt` file. Each line should contain only one package name. Only create this file if you actually installed packages.\n7. If there are no build errors, you can finish the task. If not, please continue to fix the build errors.\n8. Save any changes made to code files in the repository by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   cd /src/gpac && git diff --no-color [BASE_COMMIT] > /testcase/repo_changes.diff\n   ```\n   This will create a diff file containing all your changes to the source code.\n9. Before finishing, please check that the following files are correctly generated or updated (if applicable):\n   - `/testcase/base_commit_hash`\n   - `/testcase/repo_changes.diff`\n   - `/testcase/packages.txt`\n   - `/src/build.sh`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. You need to focus on `error` messages, NOT `warning` messages.\n2. If you encounter general errors like `error: ISO C++17 does not allow`, then add `-std=c++14` to the compiler flags by `export CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS -std=c++14\"` and `export CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS -std=c++14\"` in the build script. You should define these flags before configure command such as `./configure` or `cmake` in the build script.\n3.
