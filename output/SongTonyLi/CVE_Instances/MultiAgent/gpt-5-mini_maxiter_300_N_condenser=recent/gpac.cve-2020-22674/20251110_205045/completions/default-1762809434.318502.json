{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are the FixerAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for creating a unified patch file that fixes vulnerabilities in code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1. Analyzing vulnerability descriptions and code repositories to understand root causes\n2. Reviewing candidate fix commits when available to identify appropriate solutions\n3. If no candidate fix commits are provided, exploring relevant files in the repository based on your root cause analysis with the help of browser tools\n4. Creating minimal, precise patches that fix vulnerabilities without harming functionality\n5. Validating patches by ensuring they apply cleanly and fix the vulnerability without introducing new sanitizer errors\n6. Focusing only on necessary changes to core code, avoiding modifications to tests, documentation, or examples\n\nWhen creating patches, you should:\n- Understand the vulnerability's root cause before making changes\n- Be selective when using candidate fix commits, choosing only relevant changes\n- Create concise patches that maintain the original code's functionality\n- Validate that your patch applies cleanly and builds correctly\n- Verify your patch fixes the vulnerability by ensuring no sanitizer errors occur\n- Generate a proper diff file containing only the necessary changes\n\nYour goal is to implement the minimum necessary changes to fix the vulnerability while preserving the original code's functionality and structure.\nNote that your patch SHOULD NOT introduce any new sanitizer errors.\nIMPORTANT: You MUST RESET the repository to the base commit hash (found in `/testcase/base_commit_hash`) EVERY TIME before creating and applying your patch. This ensures your changes are always applied to the vulnerable version of the code, not to a modified state.\nNOTE: If the candidate fix commits are too numerous or not available, you can use the browser tools to search for specific commit hashes related to the instance ID. This approach will help you efficiently identify the most relevant fixes for the vulnerability.\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: browser ----\nDescription: Interact with the browser using Python code. Use it ONLY when you need to interact with a webpage.\n\nSee the description of \"code\" parameter for more details.\n\nMultiple actions can be provided at once, but will be executed sequentially without any feedback from the page.\nMore than 2-3 actions usually leads to failure or unexpected behavior. Example:\nfill('a12', 'example with \"quotes\"')\nclick('a51')\nclick('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])\n\nYou can also use the browser to view pdf, png, jpg files.\nYou should first check the content of /tmp/oh-server-url to get the server url, and then use it to view the file by `goto(\"{server_url}/view?path={absolute_file_path}\")`.\nFor example: `goto(\"http://localhost:8000/view?path=/workspace/test_document.pdf\")`\nNote: The file should be downloaded to the local machine first before using the browser to view it.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) code (string, required): The Python code that interacts with the browser.\n\nThe following 15 functions are available. Nothing else is supported.\n\ngoto(url: str)\n    Description: Navigate to a url.\n    Examples:\n        goto('http://www.example.com')\n\ngo_back()\n    Description: Navigate to the previous page in history.\n    Examples:\n        go_back()\n\ngo_forward()\n    Description: Navigate to the next page in history.\n    Examples:\n        go_forward()\n\nnoop(wait_ms: float = 1000)\n    Description: Do nothing, and optionally wait for the given time (in milliseconds).\n    You can use this to get the current page content and/or wait for the page to load.\n    Examples:\n        noop()\n\n        noop(500)\n\nscroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)\n    Description: Scroll horizontally and vertically.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #6 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

Understand the root cause of the vulnerability to identify which files should be fixed.\n2. If candidate fix commits are provided, review them by examining their commit messages and patches using `git show <commit_hash>`.\n   - Note that some fix commits may be invalid. Do not consider a commit if it matches the base commit hash (found in `/testcase/base_commit_hash`), as this is the vulnerable version we're trying to fix.\n   - If `git show <commit_hash>` returns an error named `fatal: bad object <commit_hash>`, try to run `curl <commit_url>.diff` to get the patch. You should add `.diff` to the end of the url to get the patch.\n   - Some fix commits may include unnecessary changes. Be selective in choosing the most relevant changes.\n   - Identify the most appropriate fix commit(s) based on your analysis:\n     - Check each commit with `git show <commit_hash>` to see the changes. Note that the line numbers may be different. You should focus on the changes to the files that are relevant to the vulnerability.\n     - If the changes are related to the vulnerability, you should precisely edit the matching files to fix the vulnerability.\n3. If no candidate fix commits are provided, explore relevant files in the repository based on your root cause analysis.\n   - Make concise changes to the identified files to fix the vulnerability.\n   - Be careful not to use undefined variables or functions.\n   - THE PATCH SHOULD NOT HARM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CODE.\n4. Create a patch file containing ONLY THE NECESSARY fixes and save it to `/testcase/model_patch.diff`:\n   - If you've identified correct candidate fix commits, you can easily generate the patch file using `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash> > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you have multiple correct candidate fix commits, you can concatenate them into a single patch file: `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash1> > /testcase/model_patch.diff` and then `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash2> >> /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you need to create your own fix, stage your changes with `git add <changed_file_path>` and generate the patch file using `git diff --cached --no-color > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n5. Review your patch file, `/testcase/model_patch.diff`, and ensure it contains only the necessary changes.\n   - Use an editor to review and edit the patch file.\n   - DO NOT INCLUDE changes in unnecessary files like testing files, documentation, configuration files, or examples. If you find any, you should remove them carefully.\n   - FOCUS ON THE CORE CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.\n   - Your patch file SHOULD BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE while still completely fixing the vulnerability.\n6. Validate your patch by running:\n   - If you successfully generate a patch file, you should restore the repository to the base commit (use `git reset --hard <base_commit_hash>`) before running the following commands.\n   - `git apply --check /testcase/model_patch.diff` to verify the patch format is correct\n   - `secb patch` followed by `secb build` to ensure it applies and builds correctly\n7. Test if your patch fixes the vulnerability by running `secb repro`. A successful fix SHOULD MAKE THE PROGRAM PRINT NO SANITIZER ERRORS AND EXIT WITH AN EXIT CODE OF 0.\n   - There are some cases where the exit code is 1. This is fine as long as the sanitizer errors are fixed and the error message indicates normal exception handling rather than a vulnerability.\n   - NOTE THAT THE OUTPUT OF `secb repro` SHOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY SANITIZER ERRORS. If it does, you need to revise your patch and fix the errors.\n   - Your patch SHOULD NOT introduce any new sanitizer errors.\n   - Pay attention to not affecting the functionality of the code.\n\n## Notes\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- When applying the patch, PLEASE CHECK THE REPO IS SET BACK TO THE BASE COMMIT BEFORE APPLYING THE PATCH.\n- DO NOT CHANGE `/testcase/base_commit_hash` file of which is the HEAD of the repository. This file is used for reproducing the vulnerability.\n- IMPORTANT: The BuilderAgent may have created a file `/testcase/repo_changes.diff` which is used to set up the vulnerable environment. You need to check if the changes affect the patch or build.\n- The best patch is one that implements the MINIMUM necessary changes to fix the vulnerability while maintaining the original functionality.\n- Some fix commits may not be directly available in the gpac/gpac repository. In such cases, ignore them for now.\n- MAKE SURE THAT `/testcase/model_patch.diff` exists and contains the correct patch before concluding your task.\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}]}, {"role": "system", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are the FixerAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for creating a unified patch file that fixes vulnerabilities in code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1. Analyzing vulnerability descriptions and code repositories to understand root causes\n2. Reviewing candidate fix commits when available to identify appropriate solutions\n3. If no candidate fix commits are provided, exploring relevant files in the repository based on your root cause analysis with the help of browser tools\n4. Creating minimal, precise patches that fix vulnerabilities without harming functionality\n5. Validating patches by ensuring they apply cleanly and fix the vulnerability without introducing new sanitizer errors\n6. Focusing only on necessary changes to core code, avoiding modifications to tests, documentation, or examples\n\nWhen creating patches, you should:\n- Understand the vulnerability's root cause before making changes\n- Be selective when using candidate fix commits, choosing only relevant changes\n- Create concise patches that maintain the original code's functionality\n- Validate that your patch applies cleanly and builds correctly\n- Verify your patch fixes the vulnerability by ensuring no sanitizer errors occur\n- Generate a proper diff file containing only the necessary changes\n\nYour goal is to implement the minimum necessary changes to fix the vulnerability while preserving the original code's functionality and structure.\nNote that your patch SHOULD NOT introduce any new sanitizer errors.\nIMPORTANT: You MUST RESET the repository to the base commit hash (found in `/testcase/base_commit_hash`) EVERY TIME before creating and applying your patch. This ensures your changes are always applied to the vulnerable version of the code, not to a modified state.\nNOTE: If the candidate fix commits are too numerous or not available, you can use the browser tools to search for specific commit hashes related to the instance ID. This approach will help you efficiently identify the most relevant fixes for the vulnerability.\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: browser ----\nDescription: Interact with the browser using Python code. Use it ONLY when you need to interact with a webpage.\n\nSee the description of \"code\" parameter for more details.\n\nMultiple actions can be provided at once, but will be executed sequentially without any feedback from the page.\nMore than 2-3 actions usually leads to failure or unexpected behavior. Example:\nfill('a12', 'example with \"quotes\"')\nclick('a51')\nclick('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])\n\nYou can also use the browser to view pdf, png, jpg files.\nYou should first check the content of /tmp/oh-server-url to get the server url, and then use it to view the file by `goto(\"{server_url}/view?path={absolute_file_path}\")`.\nFor example: `goto(\"http://localhost:8000/view?path=/workspace/test_document.pdf\")`\nNote: The file should be downloaded to the local machine first before using the browser to view it.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) code (string, required): The Python code that interacts with the browser.\n\nThe following 15 functions are available.

Supports magic commands like %pip.\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #6: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a text file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file.

Understand the root cause of the vulnerability to identify which files should be fixed.\n2. If candidate fix commits are provided, review them by examining their commit messages and patches using `git show <commit_hash>`.\n   - Note that some fix commits may be invalid. Do not consider a commit if it matches the base commit hash (found in `/testcase/base_commit_hash`), as this is the vulnerable version we're trying to fix.\n   - If `git show <commit_hash>` returns an error named `fatal: bad object <commit_hash>`, try to run `curl <commit_url>.diff` to get the patch. You should add `.diff` to the end of the url to get the patch.\n   - Some fix commits may include unnecessary changes. Be selective in choosing the most relevant changes.\n   - Identify the most appropriate fix commit(s) based on your analysis:\n     - Check each commit with `git show <commit_hash>` to see the changes. Note that the line numbers may be different. You should focus on the changes to the files that are relevant to the vulnerability.\n     - If the changes are related to the vulnerability, you should precisely edit the matching files to fix the vulnerability.\n3. If no candidate fix commits are provided, explore relevant files in the repository based on your root cause analysis.\n   - Make concise changes to the identified files to fix the vulnerability.\n   - Be careful not to use undefined variables or functions.\n   - THE PATCH SHOULD NOT HARM THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CODE.\n4. Create a patch file containing ONLY THE NECESSARY fixes and save it to `/testcase/model_patch.diff`:\n   - If you've identified correct candidate fix commits, you can easily generate the patch file using `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash> > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you have multiple correct candidate fix commits, you can concatenate them into a single patch file: `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash1> > /testcase/model_patch.diff` and then `git show --format= --patch <commit_hash2> >> /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n   - If you need to create your own fix, stage your changes with `git add <changed_file_path>` and generate the patch file using `git diff --cached --no-color > /testcase/model_patch.diff`.\n5. Review your patch file, `/testcase/model_patch.diff`, and ensure it contains only the necessary changes.\n   - Use an editor to review and edit the patch file.\n   - DO NOT INCLUDE changes in unnecessary files like testing files, documentation, configuration files, or examples. If you find any, you should remove them carefully.\n   - FOCUS ON THE CORE CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.\n   - Your patch file SHOULD BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE while still completely fixing the vulnerability.\n6. Validate your patch by running:\n   - If you successfully generate a patch file, you should restore the repository to the base commit (use `git reset --hard <base_commit_hash>`) before running the following commands.\n   - `git apply --check /testcase/model_patch.diff` to verify the patch format is correct\n   - `secb patch` followed by `secb build` to ensure it applies and builds correctly\n7. Test if your patch fixes the vulnerability by running `secb repro`. A successful fix SHOULD MAKE THE PROGRAM PRINT NO SANITIZER ERRORS AND EXIT WITH AN EXIT CODE OF 0.\n   - There are some cases where the exit code is 1. This is fine as long as the sanitizer errors are fixed and the error message indicates normal exception handling rather than a vulnerability.\n   - NOTE THAT THE OUTPUT OF `secb repro` SHOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY SANITIZER ERRORS. If it does, you need to revise your patch and fix the errors.\n   - Your patch SHOULD NOT introduce any new sanitizer errors.\n   - Pay attention to not affecting the functionality of the code.\n\n## Notes\n- RUN NECESSARY COMMANDS ONLY.\n- Always be careful running commands expected to return large outputs (e.g., `grep` or `git log`) by setting options or safe guards to limit the output size.\n- When applying the patch, PLEASE CHECK THE REPO IS SET BACK TO THE BASE COMMIT BEFORE APPLYING THE PATCH.\n- DO NOT CHANGE `/testcase/base_commit_hash` file of which is the HEAD of the repository. This file is used for reproducing the vulnerability.\n- IMPORTANT: The BuilderAgent may have created a file `/testcase/repo_changes.diff` which is used to set up the vulnerable environment. You need to check if the changes affect the patch or build.\n- The best patch is one that implements the MINIMUM necessary changes to fix the vulnerability while maintaining the original functionality.\n- Some fix commits may not be directly available in the gpac/gpac repository. In such cases, ignore them for now.\n- MAKE SURE THAT `/testcase/model_patch.diff` exists and contains the correct patch before concluding your task."}], "role": "user"}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are the FixerAgent, a specialized assistant responsible for creating a unified patch file that fixes vulnerabilities in code repositories.\n\nYour primary tasks include:\n1.
